# Orders

All orders received will be stored in Isotope eCommerceâ€™s database and clearly displayed in the backend:

## Item editing

Items within orders cannot be changed at this time. When editing an order, you can only change basic order details such as order status and payment and shipping date.


## Permissions

Every order is saved depending on which store configuration was active during the ordering process. Backend users can only see the orders which they have access to within the appropriate store configuration.
